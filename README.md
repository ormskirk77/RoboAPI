# RoboAPI
v0.1

This was a project I worked on to develop an API for use with a custom mezzanine board for the Ultra96. Unfortunately
this was never completed as the funding got pulled and Covid restrictions/ home schooling severely hampered progress. 
\
I liked the concept though and am in the process of developing slimmed down versions for the Raspberry Pi and Jetson 
Nano. Both of which I hope to release open source this summer.
