# RoboAPI
v0.1

This was a project I worked on to develop an API for use with a custom mezzanine board for the Ultra96. The board had an array of sensors, and motor and servo drivers. I was involved with both the hardware and software side of the project.

I  am in the process of developing slimmed down versions for the Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano. Both of which I hope to release open source this summer.
